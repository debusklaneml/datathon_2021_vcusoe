## Problem:

-   "On average, only 4% of children eligible for free or reduced-price lunch participate in the CACFP At-risk Afterschool Meals program each school day." - [No Kid Hungry Virginia](https://state.nokidhungry.org/virginia/)

-   Approximately 14.4% of children live in food-insecure households.

-   One possible cause is a lack of understanding where afterschool meals programs are offered in a child's local community.Â 

-   **There is currently no obvious tool to explore such locations available online.**

## Solution: 

-   To bridge this apparent knowledge gap, the currently available Child and Adult Food Program data available through the Virginia Department of Education includes all available food site location data needed to provide families and children this information.

## Value:

-   Streamlined and user-friendly access to searchable database of afterschool meal sites in the Commonwealth

-   Matches user to closest site based on street address

-   Parents/families/students can more easily locate nearby afterschool meals

-   Increased usage of after-school meal programs

-   Open source code/tools - this is a prototype that could be expanded to other types of services/ service types

## Product
